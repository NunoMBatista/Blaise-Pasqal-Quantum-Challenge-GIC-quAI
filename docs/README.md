# Documentation Folder

This folder contains all relevant documentation related to the **GIC-quAI** project, including thematic methodology descriptions and bibliographic references.

## Contents

### 1. Thematic Methodology Documentation
This section includes in-depth explanations of the **AI models**, **quantum circuits**, and **optimization processes** used in the project. The documentation covers:
- **Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs)** and their implementation.
- **Pulser-based Graph ML** and its role in the project.
- **Quantum Evolutionary Kernels (QEKs)** for feature extraction and classification.
- **Optimization strategies** for improving model efficiency and scalability.

### 2. Bibliographic References
Any sources cited in the research and implementation of the **GIC-quAI** project are included here. These references provide context and validation for the methodologies used in quantum computing and AI-driven colorectal cancer diagnosis.

## How to Use This Folder
- Researchers and developers can refer to the **methodology documentation** to understand the technical details of the project.
- The **bibliographic references** serve as a resource for further exploration into quantum AI applications.

For any additional information or contributions, please refer to the **main README file** or contact the project maintainers.
